**1. Interfaces**



An interface defines a set of behaviors that a class must implement, without specifying how. For an Account class, interfaces represent capabilities like:



(a)Basic account operations (IAccount):-



&nbsp;        Deposit money , Withdraw money and Check balance



&nbsp;(b)Interest-bearing functionality (IInterestBearing):-



&nbsp;        Apply interest to the balance



&nbsp;(c)Transaction capability (ITransaction)



&nbsp;          Transfer funds



&nbsp;          Generate statements



&nbsp; (d)Notifications (INotify)



&nbsp;        Notify users about balance changes or suspicious activity



&nbsp; (e)Security features (ILockable)



&nbsp;      Lock/unlock account in certain conditions



Interfaces allow flexible design, letting different types of accounts implement only the behaviors they need.



**2. Class Hierarchy**



A class hierarchy defines “is-a” relationships between classes using inheritance. For an account system:



**(a) Base class (abstract): Account**

&nbsp;    (i)Holds shared properties (like AccountNumber, Balance, AccountHolder)

&nbsp;    (ii)Implements common methods (Deposit(), Withdraw())

&nbsp;    (iii)Can declare abstract methods that derived classes must implement     (DisplayAccountType())



**(b)Derived classes: Specialized account types**

&nbsp;     (i)   SavingsAccount → may earn interest

&nbsp;     (ii)  CheckingAccount → may allow overdraft

&nbsp;     (iii) BusinessAccount → may have multiple signatories or higher limits

&nbsp;     (iv) Optional layering: Some derived classes can implement additional interfaces for extra behavior (e.g.,SavingsAccount implements IInterestBearing).





**3. Design Philosophy**



* Interfaces define what an account can do.



* Base classes define what an account is.



* Derived classes define specialized types of accounts.
* 



This design follows the SOLID principles, especially Liskov Substitution and Interface Segregation, ensuring that each account type can be used interchangeably when only its general behaviors are needed.



In short:



**Interfaces = capabilities/behaviors**



**Base class = common properties and methods**



**Derived classes = specialized types of accounts with extra features**
